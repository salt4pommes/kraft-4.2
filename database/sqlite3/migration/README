Kraft Database Migration 
========================

The Kraft database schema might change over the time.
To achieve that smoothly for the users, here is a 
database migration system. 

Every version of Kraft has a hardcoded version of the
required database schema version. In the Kraft database
there is a system table that carries the version
of the current running database schema. In case the current
database version is lower than the required, Kraft looks
in this migration directory if there is a script starting
with the number "current version +1". If found, Kraft 
executes the sql commands contained in the file. 
After all are finished, the version in the database system
table is updated.

Note that the migration file my contain lines like
-- message: bla bla

Kraft shows the message lines in the status line.
