Kraft - solution for open craft
===============================

Kraft is a program that supports craftsmen in their daily
jobs: making offers, invoices and confirmations.

Kraft needs a mysql database running. But setup is easy,
please try it. 


How to setup the database?
==========================
First, install the mysql packages of your distribution.
Create a database user and select a suitable password.
Please replace the word 'user' in the following code
examples with the user name you created.

The database can be set up using the creation scripts
in Krafts database directory. The scripts do create
the database completely new, even if they exists. 

The standard way however to let Kraft create and maintain
the database schema for you. All that needs to be done 
is to 
 - start MySQL on the system
 - have a user and password combination that has acces to
   the database
 - create an empty database with a suitable name like for 
   example "kraft".
 - enter the credentials and the database name in Kraft's
   config dialog.

Schema creation and maintenance is done by Kraft automatically.

To create the database, perform the following steps:

The database credentials must be entered into the settings
dialog in kraft after the first start. Please restart after
you have entered the data.

That's it.
